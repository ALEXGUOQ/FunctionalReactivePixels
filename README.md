Nothing too complicated yet. Next step is a login and vote mechanic to demonstrate more use of `RACSubject` and `RACCommand`. Then I think it'll be done. 

Please don't go all creepy with my consumer key. 

Installing
----------------
Clone the repo and run `pod install` from the repo's directory to install the required pods. Or if you don't like Cocoapods, just [download the zip](http://cloud.ashfurrow.com/013J0y1R3L2l).
